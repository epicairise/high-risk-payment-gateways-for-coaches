    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <details><summary>Why do coaching programs get flagged by Stripe?</summary><p>Coaching and transformation programs often trigger compliance alerts due to refund risk, lack of clear deliverables, or industry perception as "bizop-like" offers.</p></details>
    <details><summary>Can I sell high-ticket coaching with Stripe?</summary><p>Technically yes, but you're at risk of account shutdown. If you sell $1,000+ offers, use a high-risk merchant account or a split processor.</p></details>
    <details><summary>What qualifies as a "high-risk" coaching offer?</summary><p>Anything with high price tags, no physical product, refund guarantees, or claims related to income or personal transformation.</p></details>
